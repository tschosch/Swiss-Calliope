#the installed photovoltaics capacity in the baseline 2015
#the data is retrieved from {Open Power System Data, 2018} {SFOE, 2016b}
#the data is based on {Open Power System Data, 2018}, the data on solar production is assumed to be the photovoltaics installed capacity. The data package is based on data about beneficiaries of the compensatory feed-in remuneration (KEV) of {SFOE, 2016b}.
