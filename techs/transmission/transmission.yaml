      energy_eff: 0.98 #{Index mundi, 2014}, an energy efficiency for the transmission of electricity of 98% is assumed to accout for transmission losses and distribution losses. Assumption: According to the international energy agency staticists 2014, the electricity power transmission and distribution loss in Switzerland is approximately 6.7%, however, the countries with the fewest transmission and distribution losses have losses about 2%, therefore, 2% losses is assumed, as in the future, the transmission efficiency in Switzerland increases. Depending on the source, 2% is high, however, it makes also the transmission of electrcitiy less attractive, what is needed as the public acceptance of network extensions is limited.
