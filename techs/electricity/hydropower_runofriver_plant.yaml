#run of river hydropower plant #the runofriver_water_supply defines the resource (run of river water supply), the hydro_runofriver converts the water into electricity
#based on {JASM data package run-of-river production 2015}, the data package bases on {Viviroli et al., 2007} {SFOE, 2015} {DETEC & SFOE, 2015} {DETEC & SFOEN, 2015}
