#all charge rates are 1h, because for all storage technologies the lowest value for discharge is 1h based on {Luo et al., 2015} and shorter discharge rates are not considered, because the model is built for a hourly resolution
#for all storage technologies always the lowest value of the storage_cap and the om_annual is taken in the presented ranges, for energy_eff and lifetime the highest values of the range are taken
